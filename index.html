           <p id="hello-para-1">I am a fitness instructor, personal trainer, and researcher with over 20 years experience working with seniors and exercise. Originally from Brazil, I moved to Portland for love! During my doctoral studies in Portland, I met Kyle who would become my husband. Portland became my home in 2019. We have a son, Ethan.</p>
           
              <p>I have taught classes for Portland Parks and Recreation since 2022. My classes, including Pilates, water exercises, strength, endurance, and stretching, have been very popular.</p>
              <p>I worked as a Senior Clinical Research Assistant at OHSU from 2023 to 2025, where I supervised exercise clinical trials for breast and prostate cancer survivors. My role involved developing and delivering exercise programs, training instructors, and overseeing the exercise classes' progress.</p>
              <p>My passion is working with adults and seniors, focusing on exercise science, aging, quality of life and longevity. My main focus is helping seniors improve their physical health, live longer, and maintain independence.</p>
              <p>My mission is to increase longevity, promote healthy lifestyles, and improve quality of life through dynamic, personalized health and fitness programs. I am dedicated to providing unwavering support, encouragement, and education to all of my clients. I firmly believe that exercise is a powerful tool for achieving better health, greater strength and a longer life.</p>

           <p id="hello-para-1">I am a fitness instructor, personal trainer, and researcher with over 20 years experience working with seniors and exercise. Originally from Brazil, I moved to Portland for love! During my doctoral studies in Portland, I met Kyle who would become my husband. Portland became my home in 2019. We have a son, Ethan.</p>
           
              <p>I have taught classes for Portland Parks and Recreation since 2022. My classes, including Pilates, water exercises, strength, endurance, and stretching, have been very popular.</p>
              <p>I worked as a Senior Clinical Research Assistant at OHSU from 2023 to 2025, where I supervised exercise clinical trials for breast and prostate cancer survivors. My role involved developing and delivering exercise programs, training instructors, and overseeing the exercise classes' progress.</p>
              <p>My passion is working with adults and seniors, focusing on exercise science, aging, quality of life and longevity. My main focus is helping seniors improve their physical health, live longer, and maintain independence.</p>
              <p>My mission is to increase longevity, promote healthy lifestyles, and improve quality of life through dynamic, personalized health and fitness programs. I am dedicated to providing unwavering support, encouragement, and education to all of my clients. I firmly believe that exercise is a powerful tool for achieving better health, greater strength and a longer life.</p>

            <p>When I retired at age 71 and finally got a chance to incorporate daily exercise into my life, I was fortunate to discover classes being offered at my local community center by Dr. Thais Denmark. I have been doing two classes a week with Thais for more than 2½ years. I also take other classes like Zumba and yoga, but I consider Thais’ classes to be the backbone of my exercise regimen, as she includes strength, core, flexibility, mobility and balance.

          <div class="card people">
            <p>When I started training with Thais, about two years ago, I couldn’t walk around my block. I didn’t know what a plank was, let alone do one-first time I tried I just lay sobbing on the floor. Now, thanks to Thais’ personal training and her Fitness for Life classes, I enjoy 6-8 mile hikes with friends at least once or twice a week. I’m able to run around with my grandkids, garden, travel, and a million other things I thought I’d never be able to do again. Thais showed me how to get healthier and it changed my life - I’m stronger, more flexible, and a whole lot happier!</p>

            <p>I started going to Thais’ classes during COVID in the park. Before that, I hadn’t stayed with an exercise routine longer than a month. Thais cares about each person, giving encouragement and challenges for every level of fitness. She varies the routines and equipment, so it isn’t the same old thing every time. As a doctor, she knows the science behind the movements and is always ready to help a person achieve their goal. Her warmth and sense of humor helps the hour go by.</p>

            <p>I knew from the first class I took from Thais that she was someone special. Working out with her is much more than an exercise class. We learn heathy way to take care of our bodies. Her enthusiasm is infectious. Class doesn’t seem like work it’s fun.</p>

            <p>I did my personal training with Thais over a year. She’s passionate and caring, knows her stuff. She was able to meet me where I was physically, mentally, and emotionally and easily adjusted my workouts when needed. I was very grateful to be able to have her as a trainer. She’s one of the best.</p>

            <p>Thais is my favorite trainer. Her high energy keeps me motivated, her thoughtful encouragement keeps me coming back and her excellent workouts feel tailored to me. She is highly educated, and that fact puts her above the rest. I’m stronger, happier, and overall healthier because of her classes.</p>
